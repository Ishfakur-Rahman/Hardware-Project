# Hardware Project

Hardware implementation to perform custom operations

# Digital Logic Design

To perform custom made operation in hardware level with Digital Logic Design

Equipments used:
  
    -> Full Adder       - 01 unit
  
    -> Comparator       - 01 unit
  
    -> Encoder          - 01 unit
  
    -> 7SEG BCD display - 01 unit
  
    -> AND logic gate   - 11 units
  
    -> OR logic gate    - 07 units
  
    -> NOT logic gate   - 04 units
  
    -> D-Flip Flop      - 03 units
  
Operation Performs:
  
    -> Addition when input is less than 6
  
    -> Subtraction when input is greater than 6
  
    -> Shows output C when input is equals to 6
